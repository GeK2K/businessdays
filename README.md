# businessdays

To value financial instruments or calculate accrued interest, it is 
essential to be able to calculate the duration between any two dates.

Counting the number of calendar days or the number of working days 
between any two dates is an important step in this calculation,
and this count must take very precise account of the calendars and 
conventions in force.

The `businessdays` module is intended to help the user in this delicate work.
